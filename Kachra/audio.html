    <p><h2>What is MERN stack?</h2></p>
    <p><h3>MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

        MongoDB - document database
        Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
        React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
        Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server
        
        
        Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.</h3></p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Why choose the MERN stack?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Let’s start with MongoDB, the document database at the root of the MERN stack. MongoDB was designed to store JSON data natively (it technically uses a binary version of JSON called BSON), and everything from its command line interface to its query language (MQL, or MongoDB Query Language) is built on JSON and JavaScript.

        MongoDB works extremely well with Node.js, and makes storing, manipulating, and representing JSON data at every tier of your application incredibly easy. For cloud-native applications, MongoDB Atlas makes it even easier, by giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on the cloud provider of your choice, as easy as a few button clicks.
        
        Express.js (running on Node.js) and React.js make the JavaScript/JSON application MERN full stack, well, full. Express.js is a server-side application framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses, and makes it easy to map URLs to server-side functions. React.js is a frontend JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces in HTML, and communicating with a remote server.
        
        The combination means that JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it fast to build on and reasonably simple to debug. Plus, you only have to know one programming language, and the JSON document structure, to understand the whole system!
        
        MERN is the stack of choice for today’s web developers looking to move quickly, particularly for those with React.js experience.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">MERN Use Cases</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN - though it’s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces.

        A few examples might be: - Workflow management - News aggregation - Todo apps and Calendars - Interactive forums / social products
        
        And whatever else you can dream up!</p>
